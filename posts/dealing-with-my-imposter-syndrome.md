I am good at what I do, I‚Äôve been doing it for a long time, I‚Äôve had much success, people around me say I‚Äôm good, so why can‚Äôt I shake this feeling that I am not good enough.

I compare myself to others, most of the time people I think are better than me, and feel inadequate. Two people in particular, we used to be classmates, they probably haven‚Äôt given me a second thought since. Every time I think about sharing something their faces come up and I start wondering what they will think, that it‚Äôs not good enough and they will ridicule me. I don‚Äôt even know where those feelings came from because they have never even acted that way about anything I ever did.

I look at where I am in my life now and I think I have not accomplished as much as I thought I would, or what I think others expected me to have accomplished at this point in my life (and I am only 27). I‚Äôve been afraid the world will think less of me if they find out who I really am.

I see all the great people I admire, musicians, software developers, entrepreneurs, and I start to think I have nothing to offer compared to them. Why would anyone care about what I do when there‚Äôs all that great stuff out there? I still think they will probably think I suck, even though my personal experience tells me otherwise. So many people tell me how they are impressed by that website that I made, or how great my guitar sounded. I‚Äôve literally had people worship me like a god, and I down play it by comparing myself to all the greats.

I‚Äôve spent quite a considerable amount of my adult life not putting myself out there, for not feeling good enough. I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore. I‚Äôve come to realize that there is actually a name for it and that many people go through it, even many successful people and people I admire. Just knowing that it‚Äôs imposter syndrome has helped me to start to deal with these feelings and begin to do the things I want to do.

So I‚Äôve decided the 2020‚Äôs is the decade for me to overcome this and live my life to the fullest. I am still convincing myself that there is nothing really ‚Äúspecial‚Äù about great people, that I matter, that I am good enough.

So 1st January 2020, I am starting this site as my leap of faith, and I just paid for it for the entire decade too üôÇ

I will not let anyone limit what I can be. Especially myself.

I will be anything I want to be, I am **Undefined**<< (f*or the non programming people: [undefined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_value) here meaning a [variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)) that has not been initialized yet but can be set to any value)*.
